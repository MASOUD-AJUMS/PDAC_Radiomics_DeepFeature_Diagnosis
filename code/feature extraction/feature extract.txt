The Deep-feature-extract.ipynb notebook implements a 3D convolutional autoencoder to extract deep learning features from volumetric medical images in NIfTI format. It defines an encoder-decoder architecture that compresses 3D image patches into a compact bottleneck feature vector, which serves as a learned representation of the input. The notebook includes functions to load and resize both images and corresponding segmentation masks, ensuring alignment and appropriate preprocessing. It processes each labeled region in the masks by cropping, resizing, normalizing, and then passing the data through the encoder to obtain deep features. The extracted features for all regions across multiple images are saved in an Excel file for further analysis.

The radiomics-extract.ipynb notebook is centered on extracting handcrafted radiomic features from medical images using the PyRadiomics library. It facilitates loading medical images and their segmentation masks, then applies PyRadiomics feature extraction methods to quantify tumor characteristics such as texture, shape, and intensity patterns. These features are useful for radiomic analysis and can be integrated into machine learning workflows for clinical decision support.

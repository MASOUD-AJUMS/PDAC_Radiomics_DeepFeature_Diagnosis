The provided code is a comprehensive Python script designed for machine learning classification tasks involving multiple feature selection methods and classifiers. It begins by importing necessary libraries for data manipulation, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The script defines functions for adding ensemble classifiers (hard voting and stacking), saving evaluation results including classification reports and confusion matrices, and generating comparative charts of model performance metrics. It processes a dataset by loading, cleaning, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and balancing classes using SMOTE. The core part involves applying various feature selection methods such as SelectKBest with mutual information and ANOVA, VarianceThreshold, and model-based selectors using RandomForest and ExtraTrees classifiers. For each feature selection method, several classifiers including LDA, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and MLP are trained and evaluated. Metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and accuracy are computed and saved, with ROC curves plotted for visual performance assessment. The code also handles warnings, exceptions, and ensures results are stored systematically for further analysis, making it a robust pipeline for comparative model evaluation in classification problems.
